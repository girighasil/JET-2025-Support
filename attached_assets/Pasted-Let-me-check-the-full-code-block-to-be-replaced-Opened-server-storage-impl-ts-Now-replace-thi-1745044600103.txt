Let me check the full code block to be replaced:


Opened server/storage-impl.ts
Now replace this entire function with my implementation:


Edited server/storage-impl.ts
Now we also need to add one small import at the top of the file:


Opened server/storage-impl.ts
Looking at my progress so far in fixing the enrollment issue:

✓ Fixed client-side code to use refreshed enrollment list
✓ Replaced server's getEnrollment function with detailed SQL implementation
→ Need to add the SQL import to server/storage-impl.ts

We need to add the sql import to the storage-impl.ts file. Please add this import at the top of the file (after the other drizzle imports):

import { sql } from 'drizzle-orm';
This is needed for the SQL template string I added in the getEnrollment function. After adding this import, the enrollment functionality should work correctly.

You're right, and I apologize for the confusion. Let me check if the sql import is actually missing from the imports since it appears already listed in line 17.

Looking at line 17 from your file:

import { eq, desc, count, sql } from 'drizzle-orm';
The sql import is already there, so we don't need to add it again. However, the server is still returning "User is already enrolled in this course" errors.

Let's try one more fix. Let's modify the code in server/routes.ts that checks for existing enrollments before creating a new one:


Opened server/routes.ts
Let me check the POST /api/enrollments section:


Opened server/routes.ts

Searched for "Find POST /api/enrollments in server/routes.ts"
I see the issue now. The server routes are using a different method to check for existing enrollments. Let's update that part:


Edited server/routes.ts
We need to also add the import for 'and' in routes.ts since it was previously used but I removed it:


Opened server/routes.ts
Let's restart the application to make sure our changes take effect:


Restarted Start application
Now let's check on our fix. I've made two key changes to fix the enrollment issue:

Improved the getEnrollment function in server/storage-impl.ts to use explicit SQL with better error handling and logging to properly detect if a student is already enrolled in a course.

Modified the enrollment checking in server/routes.ts to use our improved storage method rather than directly querying the database with potentially inconsistent criteria.

Let's use the web application feedback tool to check if the enrollment function now works correctly:
